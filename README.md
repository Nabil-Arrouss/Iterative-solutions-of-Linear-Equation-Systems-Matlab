# Iterative Solutions of Linear Equation Systems (LES)

## Overview
The **Iterative Solutions of LES** project provides MATLAB functions for solving linear equation systems using iterative methods. The implemented methods include Jacobi iteration, Gauss-Seidel iteration, and an examination of the parameter for Smoothed Jacobi iteration. These functions aim to approximate the solution vector of a linear equation system.

- Tests are available within the source codes
